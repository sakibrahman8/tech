# Task 02 - Track your work (15 minutes)

## Introduction

Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:

1. [What is Agile?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile)
2. [What is Scrum?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)
3. [What is Kanban?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban)
4. [What is Agile Development?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development)

To help you with Agile project management, we have [GitHub project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects). With GitHub project boards, you can quickly and easily start tracking your backlog, as well as tasks, issues, bugs, and features associated with your project.

Review the following introduction to GitHub project boards: [GitHub project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects).

## Description

In this task, you will show the Munson's Pickles and Preserves team how to perform a variety of tasks around project and work tracking.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Add other learners from your team room as contributors to your repository.
2. Create a new project using the "Team backlog" template.
3. Ensure that this new project is linked with your repository.
4. Create five draft issues in total, named `Issue 1`, `Issue 2`, `Issue 3`, `Issue 4`, and `Issue 5`. When creating each issue, make sure to assign an owner for each issue to someone from your team room. Then, convert `Issue 3` from a draft issue to an issue and then select the repository you have created. Look at the difference between a draft and your converted `Issue 3` issue.
5. Move all of your issues to the "Ready" column and convert each one from a draft to an issue.
6. Move `Issue 1` to the "In Progress" column.
7. Ask the team member to whom you assigned `Issue 1` to close the issue. Review your project board to see if the issue automatically moved to the "Done" column.
8. Create a new view to show all of your issues as a table.
9. Add a custom field to your issue. The custom field should be called "Complexity" and will be a single select type with the following options: Very Easy, Easy, Hard, and Very Hard.

## Success Criteria

- You have added one or more collaborators to your repo.
- You have a project board using the automation Kanban template. This project board contains five issues. Of those, four are open and a team member closed the fifth.
- New issues appear under the "New" column.
- Closed issues automatically appear under the "Done" column.
- You have a table view in addition to your Backlog Board.
- You have a custom field called Complexity on your issues.
